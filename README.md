# Picocomputer Project

The Picocomputer project is an endeavor to emulate a classic PC system, reminiscent of late 80s and early 90s computers, on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040 microcontroller). It aims to provide a lightweight and educational platform for experiencing retro computing and understanding low-level system emulation.

## Key Features

*   **8086/8088 CPU Emulation:** At its core, the project emulates an Intel 8086/8088 processor.
*   **Retro Peripheral Emulation:** Includes support for common peripherals from the era.
*   **Text and Graphics Modes:** Supports various display modes common in early PCs.
*   **Sound Emulation:** Recreates sound capabilities of classic sound cards.
*   **Designed for Raspberry Pi Pico:** Optimized for the RP2040 with minimal external components.

## Supported Hardware Emulations

### Sound Card Emulations

The emulator supports the following sound card emulations:

*   Tandy 3-voice
*   Creative Music System (Gameblaster)
*   Sound Blaster
*   Adlib

### Graphical Adapter Emulations

The emulator supports the following graphical adapter emulations:

*   CGA (Color Graphics Adapter)
*   TGA (Targa Graphics Adapter)
*   VGA (Video Graphics Array)

## Getting Started
